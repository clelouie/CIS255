3.23 LAB: Interstate highway numbers

Program to output type (source or auxiliary), direction, and if applicable service highway
of an user inputted highwayNumber.
First determines highway direction based on if highwayNumber is odd/even.
Then determines if highway is primary, auxiliary, or not a valid highway.
If auxiliary determines service highway. Outputs all relevant information.
